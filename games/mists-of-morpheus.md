    blurb: |-
        Nightmares are even worse when you're awake...

        This game is my attempt to translate the "platformer" video game into a board game.  The hero of the game is Nekawa, a boy trapped in a nightmare and trying to escape.  The players each play a part of Nekawa's mind, each with a special role in helping Nekawa get out of his nightmare.

        As the game is played, the players build the map over which Nekawa must traverse.  Traps and Monsters will appear on the map which Nekawa must either defeat or go around - but the only way to escape the map and go to the next level is to defeat three traps or monsters.  Each undefeated monster on the board increases Nekawa's Terror, as does losing a fight to some monsters and traps.  If Nekawa's terror level rises too high, he'll be trapped in the nightmare forever!
