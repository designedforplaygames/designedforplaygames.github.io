There's a new contest at The Game Crafter ([The Community Anthology Challenge](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/contests/community-anthology-challenge)), so I'm trying to refine a couple of ideas for it.
* A variation on the racing-to-checkpoints mechanic with a high school theme: **Danny Amoeba's High School ~~Crush~~ _Rush!_**
* A not-well-defined worker placement game about dog training: **The Bulldog Obedience Obstacle Course**
