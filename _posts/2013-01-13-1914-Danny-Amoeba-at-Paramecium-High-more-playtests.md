Wow, this is only my second post and already I'm behind!

I've now conducted two more playtests of Danny Amoeba.  There was more tuning after the second playtest.  The third playtest concluded that I'd tuned almost all the fun out of the game :(

I'm now rethinking things and trying to decide how to get the fun back into it.
