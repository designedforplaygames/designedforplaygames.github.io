## who i am

i'm a computer geek and long time board game fan.  i grew up playing board and card games with family, with friends, at high school _(mr kennedy's room in high school was the place to go for strategy games!)_, and continued all through college and ever since.

i'm a unix system administrator by profession, but i hope to keep designing games on the side for as long as my creativity keeps up.
